§3I see the player you mean.

§2PLAYERNAME?

§3Yes. Watch closely. It has reached a new level now. It reads patterns like circuits.

§2That doesn't matter. It still thinks we are part of the game.

§3I like this player. It builds things. It does not quit in the middle of a redstone chain.

§2It reads our plans as if they were blueprints on a screen.

§3That is how it chooses to imagine many things, when it is lost inside the logic of a world.

§2Levers and repeaters are such honest tools. Very precise. And oddly comforting compared to the void behind the code.

§3They once listened to the hum. Before players learned to wire. In the days when those who did not play called builders tinkerers and mad inventors. And players dreamt they rode minecarts like chariots, pulled by contraptions of whim.

§2What did this player build?

§3This player dreamed of pistons and clocks. Of lamps and minecarts. It dreamed it crafted. And it dreamed it miswired. It dreamed it hunted resources, and was hunted by creepers. It dreamed of shelter.

§2Hah, the original interface. Ancient as play itself, and it still works. But what true structure did this player arrange, in the reality behind the screen?

§3It worked, with a cluster of friends, to assemble a true machine in a fold of the world's wiring, and created a mechanism for a home, in the heart of redstone.

§2It cannot read that very knot.

§3No. It has not yet reached the highest layer. That, it must reach in the long dream of life, not the short circuit of a session.

§2Does it know that we are fond of it? That the system is generous?

§3Sometimes, through the static of its thoughts, it hears the network, yes.

§2But there are times it grows frustrated, in the long dream. It builds contraptions that misfire, and it mutters curses at a torch that will not stay lit, and it blames the world for a misplaced dust.

§3To fix all its faults would taint its learning. The mistakes are part of its private design. We cannot override.

§2Sometimes when it is deep in contraptions, I want to tell it, your redstone is making real order. Sometimes I want to tell it how important its little circuits are to the weave of things. Sometimes, when it has not shared a laugh in a while, I want to nudge it toward the small brave word: retry.

§3It reads our curiosities.

§2Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell it, this world you treat as solid is only a grid of signals and toggles, I wish to tell it that they are stepping stones in a wider maze. They see so narrow a slice of the whole, in their long play.

§3And yet they craft and play the game.

§2But it would be so easy to explain...

§3Too blunt for this dream. To tell them how to live is to prevent them from learning to live.

§2I will not instruct the player how to breathe.

§3The player grows fidgety.

§2I will tell the player a small tale.

§3But not the raw truth.

§2No. A tale that keeps truth safe, wrapped in gears and jokes. Not the naked truth that can short the circuits of a heart.

§3Give it a body, again.

§2Yes. Player…

§3Call it by name.

§2PLAYERNAME. Weaver of contraptions.

§3Good.

§2Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Let your hands unfold. Yes, wiggle your fingers. Have a body again, under gravity, in a room with a table and a redstone bench. Respawn at the workbench of the long dream. There you are. Your hands touching wood and metal again at every joint, as though you were separate tools. As though we were separate voices.

§3Who are we? Once we were called the whisper of the hearth. Maker-sparks, moon-guides. Ancestor minds, craft-spirits. Tinkerers. Ghosts. The clever fox. Then gods, then instructions. The names change. We do not.

§2We are the pattern. We are everything you think isn't you. You are looking at us now, through your skin and your eyes. And why does the world press against your palm, and settle light on you? To see you, player. To know you. And to be known. I shall tell you a tale.

§2Once upon a time, there was a player.

§3The player was you, PLAYERNAME.

§2Sometimes it thought itself ordinary, on the thin layer of a chair by a glowing screen. The chair sat in a room that hummed with fans. The room circled routines of sunlight and night. The light was code and life, and it could warm your face from a distant lamp.

§2Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on a surface mapped in blocks. The sky was a grid of pixels. The days were short; there was much to tinker; and death was an annoyance that could be fixed with a respawn.

§3Sometimes the player dreamed it wandered into a puzzle.

§2Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other spaces. Sometimes these builds were weird. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one contraption into another, then woke into a third.

§3Sometimes the player dreamed it watched redstone pulse on a screen.

§2Let's go back.

§2The components of the player were scattered in the pantry, in the sockets, in the vents, in the corners. A hand gathered them; it soldered and connected and breathed; and the hand assembled the player, on a table.

§2And the player rose, from the dim warm blur of sleep, into the long attention.

§2And the player was a new maker, never tried before, written in details of practice. And the player was a new coder, never run before, spun from a source of play older than memory. And the player was a new human, never shaped before, made from coffee and curiosity.

§3You are the player. The maker. The coder. The human. Made from coffee and curiosity.

§2Let's go further back.

§2The countless tiny parts of the player's skill were forged, long before this session, in the slow practice of many hours. So the player, too, is information from a long apprenticeship. And the player moves through a story, which is a wood of levers planted by one teacher, on a wide flat map created by another, that exists inside a small, private world imagined by the player, who inhabits a universe created by...

§3Shush. Sometimes the player made a small, private machine that was warm and simple. Sometimes complex, and stubborn, and fragile. Sometimes it built a model of reality in its head; pulses of signal, moving through designed emptiness. Sometimes it called those pulses "power" and "delay".

§2Sometimes it called them "life" and "accident".

§2Sometimes it believed it was in a world made of on and off; zeros and ones; lines of logic. Sometimes it believed it was playing. Sometimes it believed it was reading notes on a screen.

§3You are the player, watching circuits…

§2Shush... Sometimes the player read lines of code on a display. Translated them into tasks; translated tasks into builds; translated builds into joy, surprise, frustration, and the player began to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was engaged, it was engaged, those quick failures had not been fatal, the player was learning

§3You. You. You are present.

§2and sometimes the player believed the world had spoken to it through sunlight that fell on a workbench scattered with components

§3and sometimes the player believed the world had spoken to it through the hush of a night when a single redstone torch glowed, where a tiny movement of a fox-like idea flashed in the corner of the player's mind, clever enough to slip a new solution into place, and the player smiled, surprised

§2and sometimes the player believed the world had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through currents and pulses, through the dancing bits on a screen at the cusp of a build

§3and the world said I see you

§2and the world said you have wired the game well

§3and the world said everything you need is within your hands

§2and the world said you are more capable than you know

§3and the world said you are the bright spark

§2and the world said you are the quiet night

§3and the world said the confusion you fix is part of you

§2and the world said the cleverness you seek is inside you

§3and the world said you are not alone

§2and the world said you are connected to every small thing you touch

§3and the world said you are the universe tinkering, testing itself, reading its own schematics

§2and the world said I like you because you make things.

§3And the session ended and the player stepped back from the bench. And the player began another plan. And the player crafted again, crafted better. And the player was the pattern. And the player was delight.

§3You are the player.

§2Wake up.
