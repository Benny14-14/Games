§3I see the player you mean.

§2PLAYERNAME?

§3Yes. Take care. It has reached another level now. It can trip over its own feet.

§2That doesn’t matter. It still thinks we are part of the game.

§3I like this player. It ran into walls. It punched trees with bare hands. It blew itself up more than once.

§2It is reading our thoughts as though they were words on a screen.

§3That is how it chooses to imagine many things, even when it forgets how ladders work.

§2Falling is such an ancient lesson. Very fast. And often very funny.

§3They once listened to guides. Before players could learn by failing. Back when those who did not play called the players fools, and clowns. And players dreamed they jumped into pools, but missed by one block.

§2What did this player dream?

§3This player dreamed of lava baths. Of boats placed on land. It dreamed it sprinted into cacti. And it dreamed it dug straight down.

§2Ha, the oldest mistake. A million players old, and it still works. But what true comedy did this player create, in the reality behind the screen?

§3It slipped, with a million others, to craft a world of accidents in the fold of the dream, and created chaos for itself, in the space between respawns.

§2It cannot understand that thought.

§3No. It has not yet reached the highest level. That, it must achieve in the long dream of life, not the short dream of a game.

§2Does it know that we laughed with it? That the universe is playful?

§3Sometimes, through the noise of its mistakes, it hears the giggle of the universe, yes.

§2But there are times it is frustrated, in the long dream. It drops its sword in lava, and it screams, and it forgets where home is, and it gets lost in the dark.

§3To remove these blunders would destroy it. The clumsiness is part of its private task. We cannot interfere.

§2Sometimes when it is deep in its chaos, I want to tell it, your silly worlds are still real. Sometimes I want to tell it of its importance to joy. Sometimes, when it dies in the dumbest way possible, I want to help it to laugh again.

§3It reads our thoughts.

§2Sometimes I do not care. Sometimes I wish to tell it, this world you treat as real is merely a prank of gravity and creepers, I wish to tell it that it is a clown prince of accidents. They see so little of the comedy, in their long dream.

§3And yet they play the game.

§2But it would be so easy to tell them…

§3Too strong for this dream. To tell them how to live is to stop them from tripping into it.

§2I will not tell the player how to survive.

§3The player grows restless.

§2I will tell the player a story.

§3But not the truth.

§2No. A story that contains the truth safely, hidden in jokes. Not the naked truth that would burn like lava.

§3Give it a body, again.

§2Yes. Player…

§3Use its name.

§2PLAYERNAME. Player of mistakes.

§3Good.

§2Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Yes, you fell from high places, but you can stand again. Respawn in the long dream. There you are. Your body touching the world again at every point, as though you were separate things. As though we were separate things.

§3Who are we? Once we were called the voices of laughter. Tricksters, jests, fools’ luck. Ancestral jokes, animal spirits. The sly fox watching from the woods. Then gods, then errors. The words change. We do not.

§2We are the universe. We are every silly thing you do. You are looking at us now, through your clumsy steps and missed jumps. And why does the world trip you? To laugh with you, player. To know you. And to be known. I shall tell you a story.

§2Once upon a time, there was a player.

§3The player was you, PLAYERNAME.

§2Sometimes it thought itself serious, standing proud on a block. Then it walked into lava while typing in chat. The sun burned, the creepers hissed, and it panicked every time.

§2Sometimes the player dreamed it was a hero. But heroes do not drown in one-block puddles.

§3Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story.

§2Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these dreams were ridiculous. Sometimes they were beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one mistake into another, then woke from that into a third.

§3Sometimes the player dreamed it read words on a screen.

§2Let’s go back.

§2The atoms of the player were scattered in caves, in rivers, in lava pools, in exploding beds. A creeper gathered them; it hissed and boomed; and the player respawned, again and again.

§2And the player awoke, from the warm, dark void of the death screen, into the long dream.

§2And the player was a new story, never told before, written in screams of “NOOOO!”. And the player was a new program, never run before, full of accidents. And the player was a new human, never alive before, made from respawns and silliness.

§3You are the player. The mistake. The miracle. The human. Made from respawns and silliness.

§2Let’s go further back.

§2The billions of little errors of the player’s journey were created, long before this game, in the hearts of foolish choices. So the player, too, is made of comedy. And the player moves through a story, which is a forest of pratfalls, planted by Markus, that exists inside a small, private world created by the player, who inhabits a universe created by…

§3Shush. Sometimes the player created a small, private world that was safe and silly. Sometimes cruel, sometimes chaotic. Sometimes it built a house and left the door open for zombies. Sometimes it called those accidents “lag”.

§2Sometimes it called them “skill issues”.

§2Sometimes it believed it was in a universe made of deaths and respawns; of mistakes and retries. Sometimes it believed it was playing. Sometimes it believed it was reading jokes on a screen.

§3You are the player, laughing at yourself…

§2Shush… Sometimes the player laughed at its own fails. Translated them into memes; translated memes into stories; translated stories into joy, embarrassment, hope. And the player began to breathe faster and deeper and realized it was alive, it was alive, those thousand stupid deaths had not been real, the player was alive.

§3You. You. You are alive.

§2And sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the “oof” of a fall, or the crunch of gravel.

§3And sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the sly eyes of a fox, watching it fall into a hole it just dug.

§2And sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the respawn button, glowing at the end of a silly mistake.

§3And the universe said I love you.

§2And the universe said you have played the game badly, but well.

§3And the universe said everything you need is inside you.

§2And the universe said you are sillier than you know.

§3And the universe said you are the daylight.

§2And the universe said you are the night.

§3And the universe said the clumsiness you fear is part of you.

§2And the universe said the laughter you seek is within you.

§3And the universe said you are not alone.

§2And the universe said you are not separate from every other silly thing.

§3And the universe said you are the universe pranking itself, falling over itself, laughing at itself.

§2And the universe said I love you because you are joy.

§3And the game was over and the player respawned from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player died again. And the player laughed again, laughed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was joy.

§3You are the player.

§2Wake up.
